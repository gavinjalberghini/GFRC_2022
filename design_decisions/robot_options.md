## Idea for offering robot designs:
Customizable robots

User is prompted to pick a Drive Train before gaining control within the field.
- To pick a Drive Train, cursor/other input hovers over a piece of text that describes the Drive Train
	- Example: **Tank Drive** or **Swerve Drive**
	- When hovering over text, text enlargens to show that the text is able to be selected
- Potential filter between heavy versus agile Drive Trains 

After a Drive Train is selected, the user is prompted to choose manipulators.
- Each Drive Train has node slots (2-3, subject to change) that manipulators can be added on to
	- Some manipulators may have extra node slots attached, like an arm attached to an elevator
- Similar system as Drive Trains, just for manipulators instead 
	- Example: **Arm** or **Fixed Point Shooter** or **None**
	- When hovering over text, text enlargens to show that the text is able to be selected
- Potential filter between projectile-related manipulators and non projectile-related manipulators.

Once a Drive Train and manipulator(s) have been selected, the user is free to roam the field.
If possible, allow for switching between both Drive Trains and manipulators while in a hangar to easily test different combinations.
