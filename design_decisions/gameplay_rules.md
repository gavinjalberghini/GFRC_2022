# Gameplay Rules

This document lists [rules](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/2022FRCGameManual.pdf) that will be of concern for our simulation of FRC.

## Setup (Section 6.1, pg. 41)
- There are 2 alliances which are denoted RED and BLUE.
- Each alliance can be composed of up to 4 teams (**Jacoby mentions that it is usually 3 teams, so this might be a varaition in the rules**).
- Total of 22 cargos. 11 for the RED alliance and 11 for the BLUE alliance.
- Each team in the alliances may optionally preload 1 cargo in their respective robot.
- Section 6.1.1 (pg. 41) further details the exact starting position of each cargo.
- In a match, all teams of both alliances will be playing in the arena.

## Play (Section 6.2, 6.3, pg. 43)
- At the start of the match, the robots will be in the AUTONOMOUS PHASE for 15 seconds. The robots will attempt to score cargos into the hub without human input. Humans can score their own cargo into the hub. **(This phase will be skipped).**
- After the autonomous phase and for the rest of the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds, robots will enter the TELEOPERATED PHASE and will be allowed to be controlled by humans to score additional cargo and begin engaging with the hangars.

## Scoring (Section 6.4, pg. 43)
- Assessment of a cargo may be held for up to 5 seconds after the arena timer reaches 0 after the AUTONOMOUS PHASE ended. (e.g. cargo launched in air, timer reaches zero, cargo successfully lands in hub under 5 seconds, will still counts as an AUTONOMOUS PHASE score).
- Assessment of a cargo may be held for up to 10 seconds after the arena timer reaches 0 after the TELEOPERATED PHASE ended.
- Final assessment of the hangars will be made 5 seconds after the arena timer reaches 0.
- A robot can only receive points for a single rung on the hangar. The rung will be the one that is the lowest that the robot is in contact with.
- The points awarded are detailed in table 6-1 (pg. 44).

## Violations (Section 6.5, pg. 45)
- The consequences of a violation are detailed in table 6-2 (pg. 45).

## Robot Design Restrictions (Section 6.7, pg. 49, Section 9.1, pg. 69)
- Robots must stay in one piece.
- Robots may not extend more than 40 cm. beyond its frame perimeter.
- A robot can hold a maximum of 2 cargo.
- Robots cannot be more than 56 kg.
- Robots cannot be more than 132 cm. tall. This restriction is relaxed to 167 cm. when the robot is in the hangar zone.
