## Drive Train types

Tank Drive:
- Heavy, has either four or six traction wheels. Six wheels provides extra turning capabilities by lowering middle wheels.
- Simple to build, control, and is very reliable. Generally defensive due to its heaviness.

Forklift Drive:
- Similar to a Tank Drive, except has four total wheels with two front omni wheels in the front.
- Can be offensive or defensive, since it is more maneuverable than a Tank Drive.

Mecanum Drive:
- Features specialized angled wheels in each corner in order to strafe easily
- High agility alows for offensive playstyle

Swerve Drive:
- Features swerve modules, allowing powerful speed and precise turning.
- Considered the best drive train due to its versatility, however it is very difficult to program properly.

Slide Drive / H-Drive:
- Modified Tank Drive which uses omni wheels instead and includes a perpendicular omni wheel in the center of gravity.
- Can be offensive or defensive due to weight and mobility.

Kiwi Drive:
- Lightweight and triangular, which allows for high mobility and strafing.
- Generally offensively oriented due to movement capabilities.

Car Drive:
- Similar to Forklift Drive, has two omni wheels in the front for directional steering and traction wheels in the back for power.
- Can be offensive or defensive.

## Manipulators

Turret Mounted Shooter:
- Capable of shooting an object by compressing it against one or two wheels.
- Capable of rotation to angle where the gamepiece is launched without moving the robot.
- Extremely difficult to construct, even if rotation angles are fixed.

Fixed Point Shooter:
- Capable of shooting an object by compressing it against one or two wheels.
- Since the turret is fixed, cannot change rotation at all and must aim using movement.

Catapult:
- Releases stored energy, normally via springs, bungee cords, or pneumatic systems, to launch an object.
- Often more accurate than shooters due to less variables, but are significantly slower.

Floor Intake:
- Allows the robot to collect gamepieces, such as balls, from the floor.
- Can be internal using slopes or rollers within the frame, or external using appendages with certain end effectors attached.

Human Feeder Intake:
- Allows for insertion of gamepieces by players within a certain area generally along the border of the field.
- Not very common due to overall lack of efficiency in most year's competitions.

Hopper/Indexer/Magazine:
- Manipulates the gamepiece once the robot has control of it.
- Some examples include sorting different gamepieces or using conveyors to move a gamepiece to a shooter mechanism.

Elevator:
- Uses winding cable systems to move a gamepiece, sometimes assisted by an end effector.
- Significantly more complex and heavier than arms, but does not affect center of gravity.


Climber:
- Used to move the robot where wheels would not help, like climbing ropes, bars, or platforms.
- Climbers are generally used to meet an endgame requirement that forces the robot to traverse difficult terrain.

Arm:
- Basic extension of a robot, can be used to grasp or push objects.
- Multi-jointed arms are generally less heavy than a lift but can require more space to fully swing the arm.
- Can have an end effector attached for more functions.

Wrist:
- Part of a manipulator that controls rotations of end effectors.
- A sturdy wrist is important because of the forces acting on the wrist.
