## Drive Train types

Tank Drive:

- Simple to build, control, and is very reliable. Generally defensive due to its heaviness.

Forklift Drive:
- Similar to a Tank Drive, except has four total wheels with two front omni wheels in the front.
- Can be offensive or defensive, since it is more maneuverable than a Tank Drive.

Mecanum Drive:
- Features specialized angled wheels in each corner in order to strafe easily
- High agility alows for offensive playstyle

Swerve Drive:
- Features swerve modules, allowing powerful speed and precise turning.
- Considered the best drive train due to its versatility, however its very difficult to program properly.

Slide Drive / H-Drive:
- Modified Tank Drive which uses omni wheels instead and includes a perpendicular omni wheel in the center of gravity.
- Can be offensive or defensive due to weight and mobility.

Kiwi Drive:
- Lightweight and triangular, which allows for high mobility and strafing.
- Generally offensively oriented due to movement capabilities.

Car Drive:
- Similar to Forklift Drive, has two omni wheels in the front for directional steering and traction wheels in the back for power.
