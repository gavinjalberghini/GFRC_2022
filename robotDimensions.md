The robot can be a maximum height of 1.3208 meters tall at the beginning of the  match.
The robot can have a maximum perimeter of 3.048 meters, and no part of the robot can extend more than 0.4064 meters beyond that perimeter once the match has started.
The robots can have a maximum weight of 56.699 kilograms.

The cargo are 24 cm in diameter, and they weigh 270 grams.

If a cargo is dropped onto the field carpet from 92 centimeters, it will bounce between 64 cm and 76 cm.

I would not worry about the dimensions and weight of the individual parts, because different teams use different size, type, and manufactuers for their wheels, manipulators, motors, and other components. I would advice choosing a standard size and type to use for all of you models, and keeping those consistent for all the simulated bots.
